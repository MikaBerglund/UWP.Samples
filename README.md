# UWP.Samples
A repository containing sample projects covering different features of the Universal Windows Platform. 
I've created them for my personal reference, but if you can benefit from them, or if you even want to contribute, please feel free to do so.

## Design Principles
The samples in this repo are bare-bones samples contain only the minimal amount of code to demonstrate each case.
This is to make it easier to understand what is actually required to achieve certain functionality.

## Samples
